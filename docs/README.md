## OctoAcme Project Management — Brief Summary

OctoAcme manages projects through a well-defined lifecycle that emphasizes customer-first delivery, iterative development, and clear ownership. Projects progress through five key phases: Initiation (validating business needs and stakeholder alignment), Planning (creating actionable backlogs and release plans), Execution (building and testing with daily standups and regular demos), Release (deploying with proper safeguards and rollback plans), and Close & Retrospective (capturing learnings for continuous improvement). Each phase has clear deliverables, checklists, and decision gates to ensure quality and alignment.

The project management approach is built around clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Project Managers coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules, risks, and communications. Product Managers define what should be built to deliver customer and business value, owning the product vision and prioritizing the backlog. Developers design, build, test, and deliver software components while collaborating on design reviews and identifying technical risks. QA/Testing validates quality and acceptance criteria, and Stakeholders provide inputs and approvals throughout the process. Additional cross-functional roles include Scrum Masters (facilitating agile practices), UX Designers (creating user-centered designs), Technical Writers (producing documentation), Solution Architects (defining technical vision), and Business Analysts (bridging business and technical teams).

Communication is central to OctoAcme's project management strategy. Teams maintain a regular cadence with daily standups, weekly PM-PdM syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risk management follows a structured approach using risk registers to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks. Escalation paths are clearly defined from team-level through PM, Product Lead, and Sponsor levels. For incidents, blameless retrospectives ensure learnings are captured without blame.

Quality assurance practices are embedded throughout the project lifecycle. This includes unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning in CI. The execution workflow emphasizes small pull requests, clear acceptance criteria, and at least one approval before merging. Regular retrospectives help teams continuously improve their processes by capturing what went well, what could be improved, and tracking action items with clear ownership.
